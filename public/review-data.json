I have been looking for these for months and was considering a similar pair of Prada sunglasses but I found a better deal on these Miu Miu sunglasses and I love them! However, I wish the lenses were a little more protective because the lenses are a light grey shade and they aren't polarized so I feel they don't do much when it comes to protecting your eyes from the sun but they are super cute and fashion forward.",
